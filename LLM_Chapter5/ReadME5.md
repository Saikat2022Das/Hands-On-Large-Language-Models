Text Clustering and Topic Modeling

## Chapter_5:
#### This notebook provides a comprehensive guide to text clustering and topic modeling. Here are some key takeaways:
#### Text Embedding: Learn how to transform textual data (like abstracts) into numerical representations using models such as SentenceTransformer.
#### Dimensionality Reduction: Understand the application of techniques like UMAP to reduce the complexity of high-dimensional embeddings, which is crucial for both clustering and visualization.
#### Clustering: See how to apply clustering algorithms, specifically HDBSCAN, to group similar text documents based on their embeddings.
#### Topic Modeling with BERTopic: Discover how to use BERTopic, a modular framework, to perform end-to-end topic modeling by integrating embedding, dimensionality reduction, and clustering.
#### Data Visualization: Explore methods for visualizing clusters and topics, including static plots with Matplotlib and interactive visualizations provided by BERTopic.
